## PROJECT: AUTHENTICATION  Live version of project : [CLUBHOUSE](https://evening-sierra-99152.herokuapp.com/)

![ ](https://github.com/Anna-Myzukina/Authentication/blob/create-readme/app/assets/images/club.png)

## Description

    In this project, youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write 
    embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author 
    of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Environment

- [ ] Ruby on Rails version 5.1.6
- [ ] bcrypt version 3.1.12 ([bcrypt()](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby) allows you to easily harden your application against these kinds of attacks.)
- [ ] ([bootstrap-sass](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/bootstrap-sass/3.3.6) is a Sass-powered version of Bootstrap 3, ready to drop right into your Sass powered applications version 3.3.7
- [ ] Puma: A Ruby Web Server Built For Concurrency version '3.9.1'

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
